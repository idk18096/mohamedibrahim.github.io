        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          The Civil Action Project is dedicated to compassionate, community-driven responses to homelessness.
          We connect facts with action — educating our neighbors, supporting shelters, and advocating for policies
          that expand affordable housing and services.

        <h2>Key Facts & Data</h2>
        <p>Below are national figures and trends from HUD and other reputable research groups to help explain the scope of the challenge.</p>

        <ul class="stats-list">
          <li>
            <strong>771,480 people</strong> experienced homelessness on a single night in January 2024 — the largest single-night count on record (an 18% increase from 2023). 
            <div class="stat-source">Source: HUD 2024 PIT / AHAR (Dec 2024). <a href="https://archives.hud.gov/news/2024/pr24-327.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HUD press release</a>.</div>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>~274,000 people</strong> were unsheltered (living in cars, tents, or on streets) during that count. <div class="stat-source">Source: HUD PIT/AHAR. <a href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/ahar/2024-ahar-part-1-pit-estimates-of-homelessness-in-the-us.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HUD dataset</a>.</div>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>152,585 people</strong> were estimated to be chronically homeless in 2024 (long-term or repeated homelessness). <div class="stat-source">Source: Congressional and HUD analyses. <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12985" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Congressional Research Service summary</a>.</div>
          </li>

          <li>
            Black Americans are disproportionately affected: while ~12% of the U.S. population, they represented roughly ~32% of people experiencing homelessness in 2024. <div class="stat-source">Source: HUD/AHAR analyses and homelessness advocacy reports (see Sources below).</div>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="note">
          These counts are from HUD's Point-In-Time (PIT) count and the Annual Homelessness Assessment Report (AHAR). PIT gives a snapshot on a single night; AHAR compiles additional program and demographic data. Exact counts and breakout details (age, veteran status, family vs individuals) are available in the linked HUD reports.

        <h2>What We Do / Impact</h2>
        <p>
          We coordinate volunteer drives (clothing, hygiene kits, meals), partner with local shelters and outreach teams,
          and run awareness campaigns in schools and neighborhoods. We also share data and policy recommendations that help
          local leaders prioritize affordable housing and prevention programs.

          <li>Volunteer coordination and donation drives</li>
